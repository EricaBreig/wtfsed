## Description:
A simple app that lets the user find an option of what to wear at the push of a button.  The user can push the button as many times as they want, and an outfit will always be chosen at random.

## User Story:

```
AS an indecisive being who hates making decisions, I want to be able to have the application do it for me
WHEN I start the application 
THEN I am presented with the home page, showing the title of the app and its use, including a button to make a decision 
WHEN I click the start button
THEN then I am presented with a decision, chosen at random
WHEN I have decided I don't like that decision
THEN I can hit the button once more 
WHEN I hit the button again
THEN I am presented with another option
```
